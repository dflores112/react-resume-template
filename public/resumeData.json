    "bio":"I am a software engineer from Covina, California. I previously worked at a series A startup in sales and used skills that helped me in that role like communication and being quota driven which I feel will give me a leg up in my software engineering career. Those skills relate because instead of having a quota I will now be focused on shipping product in a timely manner and use my communication skills to help other software engineers understand my decision making process or talk through a technical issue I may be having.",
